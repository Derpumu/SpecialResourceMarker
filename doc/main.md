# Special Resource Marker

Scans newly discovered chunks for trees and rocks that contain special resources, i.e. things that are not wood or stone. In vanilla Factorio, this will mark huge rocks containing coal. In mods that contain special trees or rocks, like Angel's Bioprocessing, the mod shows its true purpose by marking them on the map as well.

Adding the mod to an existing game works, it will scan all already discovered chunks and add markers.

## Options
Contains an option to ignore coal: in late game vanilla you don't really care for those rocks any more, and with Alien Biomes there are so many that you might be overwhelmed by all the markers on the map (the option is set to ignore by default when Alien Biomes is active).


## Early development
The version number says it all - this mod is in early development. When you have suggestions for features or bug reports or other input, get in contact in the discussions, on GitHub, or ping me in the Factorio Discord!
